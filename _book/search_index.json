Of course, other folder set-ups are possible, so be aware of your own as you follow the rest of this guide. The path to my main project folder,for example, is c:\\users\\jt\\Documents\\Projects\\StataWrangling 4.2 Exercise If you do not have a folder for your project (including for this training series project!), create one now with subfolders as above. You do not need to create the two do files in the scripts folder. You can do this in Stata. First type pwd and then hit enter. Check the result and make sure that it shows the directory where you want to store your projects. To create the structure, you will find it easier right now using your computers graphical user interface, but in case you want to do it in Stata, type the following Stata commands on the console (the command window), following each by return (replace ProjectName with a suitable name for your project) mkdir ProjectName cd ProjectName mkdir raw_data mkdir scripts mkdir documentation mkdir graphs cd documentation mkdir PDFs mkdir Word_docs cd .. pwd Check that you end up back in your new project folder. 4.3 Common File types You will commonly encounter three types of file specific to Stata The .dta file which is Statas proprietary data format; The .do file which is Statas scripting file type; The .log file which is the file type recording session logs.

Simple programs made of text files of Stata commands. Lets start off by creating a new do file, type doedit newdo.do You can also create a new do file editing session from the Window menu in Stata. Clear everything to make sure theres nothing leftover in our environment clear all 5.1 Initialising your script In a new data wrangling script you should start a log; make sure you are in the correct project directory; clear working memory. So to start this process, in your new do file add these lines: capture log close log using &quot;MainProjectName $S_DATE.log&quot;, append or capture cmdlog close cmdlog using &quot;CommandsProjectName $S_DATE.log&quot;, append to log commands only and not output. 5.2 Exercise Using your internet searching powers, find out why we wrote capture log close at the start of the script, rather than just log close. 5.3 Which directory? Next you should make sure you are in the correct directory. To check which directory you are currently in type pwd on the Stata console. 5.4 Change to your data directory Change directory to the folder that will hold your projects raw data files (that is data that you have not processed or transformed). Normally for a data wrangling script, this will be the raw_data directory for the project and you change to that directory by typing a line like cd c:\\users\\jt\\Documents\\Projects\\StataWrangling\\raw_data\\ (you must alter this to point at your folder). When you write code to read a raw data file, you will want to make sure that it is read into this directory. 5.5 Exercise Close the log file or log files you have created and outside of Stata find the files and view the content. "],["dataset.html", "6 Dataset 6.1 Data Types 6.2 Interpretation of describe output 6.3 Interpretation of codebook 6.4 Exercise", " 6 Dataset Were using a dataset of examination results from thirty school students. These data are in Stata format. Each case or observation is a row with variables in columns1.

Read the main data file by adding this command to your do file: use https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ccaajim/results When you first read a datafile, you should always describe the data; check the codebook. You can do this for the complete set of variables for simple cases, but you may wish to be selective when you have a lot of variables. 6.1 Data Types The examination data is quite simple. In your do file add describe codebook And run the do file. This first command produces The main Stata results screen showing the output of desc 6.2 Interpretation of describe output This output shows first how many observations there are in your data and how many variables. The table that follows includes some detail about each variable: 6.2.1 Storage type There are two basic data types in Stata: numeric and string data. String data has two subtypes: strL (L for long) variables can store phenominal amounts of character data (2 billion) and str# (where # is a number) and have a limit on length of 2045 characters. Numeric data is of one of five types: type precision range byte integer -127 to 100 int integer -32,767 and 32,740 long integer -2,147,483,647 and 2,147,483,620 float real 8 digits of accuracy double real 16 digits of accuracy 6.2.2 Format types These are associated with variables - each has a default, which determines how values are displayed, so that regardless of the precision of the type, the number of decimal places and the width in number of characters to be displayed can be fixed. So a format type %9.0g is a left justified number of maximum 9 characters in width and with specific decimal precision (although in this case zero means just as many as can be displayed for this width). 6.3 Interpretation of codebook The output of codebook shows you the data type of the variables; the range and the numeric unit of measure; the number of unique values in the data; the number of values missing; the mean value for continuous variables; the standard deviation; the percentile values for the 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% points. The value of output from codebook is enhanced if you have taken care to (#Labelling) [label] variables and values. 6.4 Exercise What are the types and formats of the variables maths, english, history?

This command sorts on a list of variables (at least one) in ascending order. Run this code in the command window sort sex maths If you list the data now and scroll through the output, you will see it is sorted first by sex ascending and then by maths ascending. While useful, there is a more flexible command for sorting values. 7.4 gsort The command gsort also sortson on a list of variables, but you can determine the order by prefixing a variable name with + for ascending order or - for descending order. Try the following in the command window gsort +sex -class - maths Again you should list and scroll and note effect. "],["detecting-and-correcting.html", "8 Detecting and correcting 8.1 Exercise 8.2 Exercise 8.3 Replacing values 8.4 Exercise", " 8 Detecting and correcting In the data as you find it, there is an anomalous maths score. We can find this my simple inspection of the data because we have a small data set and few variables. We could for example use list with an if condition, like this list surname maths if maths &gt; 100 which would list any cases with a maths value greater than the allowable maximum. If we had a larger data set with many variables this would be much more difficult. We will write some code to help us in the detection of variables. In Stata we can use programming functions that return values2. Many functions return values true or false. There is a function inrange(variable, min, max) that returns true if variable is greater than min and less than or equal to max. We negate functions with the operator meaning not: !. 8.1 Exercise In your script add the following lines: gen anomaly = 0 replace anomaly = 1 if !inrange(maths,0,100) The Stata command gen creates a new variable in our data set (for all cases) and gives it an initial value. The command repace replaces the values for cases of a variable - in this case with a condition. 8.2 Exercise After you run the lines above, use list with if to determine if there are any anomalous cases in your data set. Have you detected any? How many? The Stata symbol for or is | sometimes called bar or pipe. In Stata you can create a complex condition (like if) with the pipe, but note that each side of the pipe must be a complete Stata statement. So, if we consider a comparison with English, you must say: Would you like coffee or would you like tea? and not Would you like coffee or tea? Alter the second line in the example above so that it checks not only maths but the english, and history variables as well. 8.3 Replacing values In the data for this tutorial, there is one score in maths that is clearly out of range. In this case we need to replace the maths score for the student with surname DENCIK. We can do that on the Stata command line with a replace command. For the sake of this exercise, snapshot the current state of your data with preserve and then type this command on the console: replace maths = 57 if surname == &quot;DENCIK&quot; When you have inspected the data to ensure the correction has been made, restore the snapshot from before correction (This is to ensure that you can complete the next exercise. In a normal situtation you might preserve only at the end of your analysis or simply not save the results of changes you make to your data). 8.4 Exercise Correct the anomalous maths score, but do not base the replacement on the surname variable, rather use only the maths values. "],["generating-new-values-and-recoding-existing-values.html", "9 Generating new values and recoding existing values 9.1 New values 9.2 Exercise 9.3 Recoding values 9.4 Exercise", " 9 Generating new values and recoding existing values 9.1 New values There are two commands that generate new values in Stata: generate (which we have already seen, abbreviated to gen)and egen (extended generate). The first is a very fast, basic Stata command and should be used whenever simple arithmetic or other manipulation of your data will create the new values, for example generate avxm = (maths + english + history)/3 The second is a more complicated command that can apply any of a list of pre-defined functions to your data. The same result as above for example can be created by egen avxm = rowmean(maths english history) The full list of functions for egen is listed in Stata help. Both commands can be used in conjunction with replace to achieve complex operations of generation and modification of variables, for example we may generate a new value and then conditionally make it missing for some cases: generate avxm = (maths + english + history)/3 replace avxm = .a if avxm &lt; 40 9.2 Exercise Use either of generate or egen to create a new variable avxm that is the mean of the three scores, maths, english, and history. Round the result to show no decimal places.(Read the Stata help on the round() function). 9.3 Recoding values It is not unusual to need to change the coding of a measure. For instance, we may have a continuous variable like avxm, that we wish to recode into groups (giving a ranked variable that we will call stream). We can do this in a number of ways in Stata. I will use the most obvious, if verbose, method first. Suppose that having calculated avxm as average examination score for each student, we now want to group the students according to their avxm. We will use the Stata if statement to do this. When you undertake a more complicated data management task, it is very helpful to write out in pseudo-English what you want to do. So, I want to apply this rule to my data:     If avxm &gt;= 60, stream = high,         if avxm &lt; 60 &amp; avxm &gt; 50, stream = mid,             if avxm &lt; 50, stream = low I have purposefully written this out in the most explicit way. Now Im going to reduce the complexity a little:     If avxm &gt;= 60, stream = high,         if avxm &lt; 50, stream = low,             else stream = mid In this version I dont have to spell out the compound condition. Win! Now, to write this in Stata, I will move the default else condition to the top and use gen and replace with if to get my new variable: gen stream = 2 //the else or default condition replace stream = 3 if avxm &gt;= 60 //cut off the top replace stream = 1 if avxm &lt; 50 //cut off the bottom I often prefer a numeric code to a string variable. Notice that I have used 3 for high against my own prejudice that it should be 1. In this way Stata and I will agree about ordering the data. I will explicitly label the data later to make it easier to read. 9.4 Exercise Examine the first ten cases in the data. Do they appear to be assigned to the correct stream according to the rule above? Read these instructions on using cut and then use cut to create a new variable with the same distribution as ranking - give the variable any new name you like.

So, we use a list of variables after a command name and we may or may not then apply some criterion to filter the cases displayed. This works. It is however needlessly repetitive and sometimes we should consider temporarily reducing the data set in memory and operating over all data; creating a filter variable to reduce complex selection expressions. In what follows I mainly treat selecting data in the traditional way, but I will suggest that judicious use of restoreand preserve as well as the practice of storing selection criteria in filter variables can improve your Stata experience.3 10.1 Selecting variables We will use the command list which displays rows of variable values to illustrate the selection of variables. With most commands, variables can be included in the varlist that follows a command name. So on the command line we can type list maths english history which displays all the values for those three variables. Much of the time this is the only selection of variables you need. But, there are times when you wish to select a subset of variables for manipulation perhaps for a series of operations. In this case we can use preserve and restore. The command preserve takes a snapshot of a data set. If we then manipulate or modify the data, we can return to the snapshot state with the command restore. You can now use drop varlist to remove variables from the workplace or keep varlist to specify variables to be kept in the work space. 10.2 Exercise Use the preserve command to take a snapshot of your data and then drop the variables surname and sex. List the first ten observations in your data. Use restore to return to your original data. List the first ten observations in your data. Describe to your rubber duck4 the effect of preserve and restore. 10.3 Selecting cases If you need to select cases, that is rows from your data, you should use the if operator in your command. We will use list again to illustrate. Type the following on the console list surname english maths if english &gt; 60 &amp; maths &lt; 50 We can add wildcards to our selection criteria using regular expressions. To do this we use Statas regexm() function. The following example illustrates the use of regexm()in a compound condition on list 5 . list surname english maths if !regexm(surname,&quot;\\^B&quot;) &amp; english \\&gt; 60 &amp; maths \\&lt; 60 10.4 Using a filter variable A filter variable is a variable created to indicate membership of a sub-group of your data. Using the generate command with if conditions you can reduce a complex selection operation to a simpler expression. For example, suppose that you wish to select cases where class is three; maths is less than 55; history is greater 55. If we first try with a list command, we will write list if class == 3 &amp; maths &lt; 55 &amp; history &gt; 55 You should find that this lists just three cases. If we want to continually operate over just these cases for some part of our analysis then rather than writing this complex expression each time, we can generate a variable to act as a filter generate filtervar = 1 if class === 3 &amp; maths &lt; 55 &amp; history &gt; 55 and now the selection condition for further operations is reduced to if filtervar == 1 This method requires some discipline to remove filter variables (with drop) when their work is done. 10.5 The uses of _all Stata has a built in macro (Stata speak for a script variable) named _all that contains all the variable names currently in memory. The _all macro is obviously useful. but, it can be more useful combined with drop and keep. The command drop varlist removes variables from the workspace, while keep varlist drops all but the named variables. So, if we want to produce summary statistics for all continuous variables in our data, we can use keep followed by the list of names and then calculate the summaries for _all. 10.6 Exercise Add the following lines to your script preserve keep maths english history summarize _all restore What is the effect of these lines? How many variables are in working memory after the keep command? How many variables are in working memory after the restore command? Add the following lines to your script preserve keep maths english history tabstat _all, statistics(mean sd var kurt skew) restore Answer these questions: What is the Skewness of the mathematics scores? Which scores show more variability, English or History? Which subject has the lowest mean score? 10.7 Creating a custom variable list Since many commands take a list of variables to operate on, it can be useful to create a specific list of variables that you can easily refer to repeatedly. We will do this with a Stata macro. Stata macros are programming variables or, if you prefer, containers for text. Stata has both local and global macros and for the most part you will use local macros in your scripts. Add the following lines to your script local conts maths english history summarize `conts&#39; Since in this case we dont drop any variables, we dont need to use preserve and restore to work on a subset of our data unless we otherwise transform any values.

It is useful therefor to be able to attach a label to a variable, especially for use in output such as graphs. Add the following line of code to your script label variable sex &quot;Gender&quot; now use the table command to view a table of frequencies of the sex variable. What has been the effect of your line of code? 11.2 Exercise Create appropriate labels for the variables in your data set. 11.3 Values When we record some categorical variables, we will often use a code to represent the different possible values. for example, we might code eyecolour as Code Meaning 1 Brown 2 Blue 3 Grey 4 Green 5 Other The use of numeric codes is very convenient in many circumstances, but it is not very human friendly. We would also like to put more meaningful labels for the values on output such as tables and graphs. To do this we create a label set and apply it to the variable values. The label set is a list of codes and meanings create by a command like label define eyecolourlabels 1 &quot;Brown&quot; 2 &quot;Blue&quot; 3 &quot;Grey&quot; 4 &quot;Green&quot; 5 &quot;Other&quot; We then apply the labels to values of a variable eyecolour with a command like label values eyecolour eyecolourlabels 11.4 Exercise Create an appropriate label set for the variable sex in your data set and apply it to the values of sex.

There are several useful Stata procedures for this task, including: simple visualisatons: box plots; histograms; bar charts; summary statistics; tables. 12.1 Simple visualisations For continuous numeric data you can create box plots and histograms. In your do file add the line hist maths You might like to create graphs for a list of variables. You can try to first create a macro containing the variable names, then create the histograms. As in the following lines local conts maths english history hist `conts&#39; Unfortunately, this does not work (since hist can only be followed by a single variable) and in any case soon as Stata creates a new graph, the currently open graph window is destroyed. We can avoid this by creating and exporting the histograms we create in a program 6. Add the following lines to your script foreach var in `conts&#39; { hist `var&#39; graph export `var&#39;.png } Once this loop terminates, you can look in your current directory to find the exported graphs. You can dig deeper into your data by grouping values by any factor (categorical) variables, for example graph box `conts&#39;, by(sex) 12.2 Exercise Create histograms for the english andhistory data. How similar or dissimilar do you think these data are? Create box plots of maths for each level ofsex. How do you think the male and female maths scores compare? Using your web searching powers, see if you can generate a box plot of maths scores that is subset by both sex and class. You should look out for mention of an option `over. Having created the box plot by sex above, open Statas graph editor and add the title to the plot Maths scores by gender. 12.3 Summary statistics Quick summary statistics for continuous numeric variables can be calculated with the summarize command. Try the command summarize maths You will see that this gives a brief summary of the variable. you can add detail to the summary with the detail option summarize maths english, detail Summary statistics for continuous numeric variables can also be created with the tabstat command. tabstat maths english and you can specify statistics with the statistic option: tabstat maths english, statistic(median var skew) A Stata command that calculates statistics will display some default output. You can check what is displayed in help. However, many routines actually compute more statistics than are displayed. These quantities are stored in the return list for the command and can be accessed after it runs. For descriptive statistics, the list is called r(). The brackets indicate that r() is an array and that we can select particular statistics from the list. Consider summarize maths The default output looks like Variable | Obs Mean Std. dev. Min Max -------------+--------------------------------------------------------- maths | 30 53.76667 6.295501 39 64 If we now use the command return list we see scalars: r(N) = 30 r(sum_w) = 30 r(mean) = 53.76666666666667 r(Var) = 39.63333333333333 r(sd) = 6.295501039101918 r(min) = 39 r(max) = 64 r(sum) = 1613 These further can be viewed individually using, for example, di r(Var) and in more advanced procedures you can use them in collections and in mathematical expressions. 12.4 Exercise Compute the summary statistics with detail for history. Use the return list from the command and then display the kurtosis of the variable. 12.5 Tables As well as tables of statistics for continuous data calculated with tabstat, you can create tables of frequencies for categorical data. For example table sex You can add percentages and cumulative percentages by using tab (short for tabulate) instead of table tab sex These commands create one-way tables of frequencies. A two-way table can be created by adding a variable tab sex class tabulate sex class You will see that the difference in output here is cosmetic. The syntax of table is actually table (rowvariables) (columnvariables) where the parentheses are only required if you have more than one variable in row or column. 12.6 Tables with custom statistics It is possible to create tables that show expected as well as observed frequency values table sex class, expected and to add specific detail about a continuous variable by using the command() option7. For example: table (class) (sex),command(r(sd) r(skewness): summarize maths, detail) You will notice that the command option uses values from the return list for (in this example) the summarize command.
