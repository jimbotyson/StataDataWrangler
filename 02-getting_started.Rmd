# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

These tutorials assume no knowledge of Stata but do assume that you are comfortable using a computer with a modern user interface (for example Windows, MacOs, linux with Ubuntu) and that you will be ok typing commands in a console or a script. You will also need to learn how to navigate a folder or directory tree.

## Software Requirements

Recent versions of Stata, 17 or later are required. You can check your version from the command line[^getting_started-1] with `version`.

[^getting_started-1]: See [Stata features page](https://www.stata.com/features/overview/graphical-user-interface/ "https://www.stata.com/features/overview/graphical-user-interface/").

## How to use these materials

Test all the code you see. Some of the code is written to be added to a script and you should develop a single script for all sections since some of the later material will assume that you have run earlier example code. Sometimes the tutorial suggests that you run a command on the console or command line and you should do so. Don't add commands intended for the console to your script - they may cause your script to break and fail.

Code to be executed and run by you looks like this:

    type this at the console and hit return
    or add it to a script and run the script

Generally the tutorial will be explicit about when you should add code to a script.

As the series progresses, I will provide less explicit detail in my instructions.  You will move from 

    type these characters and hit return
    
to

"The Stata command for a oneway anova is `oneway`.  Use this command to test the mean of `boodpressure` by `ethnicity`"

## Completion status
